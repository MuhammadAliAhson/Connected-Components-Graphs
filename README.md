# Connected_Components_Graphs
 Strongly connected labels and Weakly connected labels are part of a  graph. Either it is directed or undirected graphs.  Hello Everyone.  We all know that the Graph is used in Mapping analysis, Short distance measurements, Data Management, and much more.  So, I have made this Program in Python language in which you can find the connected components more precisely the most strongly connected components.  In the code, I have used the DFS Algorithm to find the connected components (nodes). The program will make a text file for the connected and least connected nodes present in a graph.  #Note   You Need a Good GPU to run this code for a massive number of nodes in a graph.  
In this you need to put your text file which contain the nodes and the the program will generate the result file with the respective connected components.
You can spilts the graph for larger values and then find the average if ypou are conmfortable.
If you follow this method then your answer can be little different form the rest, because of the average.
