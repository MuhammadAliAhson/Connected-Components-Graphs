# Connected_Components_Graphs
 Strongly connected labels and Weakly connected labels are part of a  graph. Either it is directed or undirected graphs.  Hello Everyone.  We all know that the Graph is used in Mapping analysis, Short distance measurements, Data Management, and much more.  So, I have made this Program in Python language in which you can find the connected components more precisely the most strongly connected components.  In the code, I have used the DFS Algorithm to find the connected components (nodes). The program will make a text file for the connected and least connected nodes present in a graph.  #Note   You Need a Good GPU to run this code for a massive number of nodes in a graph.  
In this you need to put your text file which contain the nodes and the the program will generate the result file with the respective connected components.
You can spilts the graph for larger values and then find the average if ypou are conmfortable.
If you follow this method then your answer can be little different form the rest, because of the average.

## README

This code implements an algorithm to find strongly connected components in a directed graph. It reads a text file (task1.txt) which contains edge information of the graph. The graph has 5105043 nodes and 6517187 edges. 

### Prerequisites 
* Python 3.x 
* `collections` module 
* `os` module

### How to use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the code in Python. 
3. The code reads the 'task1.txt' file which contains the edge information of the graph. 
4. The program creates 10 graphs for the edges and applies DFS algorithm to each one of them. 
5. The strongly connected components of the graphs are written to the 'Result1.txt' file. 
6. Open the 'Result1.txt' file to see the strongly connected components of the graphs.

### Files in Repository 
* `task1.txt` - A text file containing the edge information of the graph.
* `Result1.txt` - A text file to write the strongly connected components of the graphs.
* `README.md` - Information about the repository.

### Running the Code 
```python
python scc.py
```

### Output
The output of the program is written to the 'Result1.txt' file. The strongly connected components of the graphs are written in this file.
